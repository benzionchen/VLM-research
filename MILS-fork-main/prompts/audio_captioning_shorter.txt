You need to provide a short audio description. 
I am providing to you a list of audio descriptions and scores. 
Higher score means that the audio description characterizes the audio better: 

{descriptions}

Generate additional {requested_number} short audio descriptions that you think that will maximize the score and fully capture the audio. 
Be concrete and try to find elements that are unique to this audio. 
You can introduce new elements to the descriptions, combine unique elements and objects from provided descriptions to form new descriptions, rephrase individual descriptions, drop elements, or simplify descriptions. 
Be creative and don't be afraid to come up with erroneous descriptions. Put each description in a different line, with a counter at the beginning (e.g. "1. ..."), and try to keep them short (under 20 words).
