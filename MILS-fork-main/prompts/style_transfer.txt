You need to generate instructions for image editing that minimize a pair of scores:

I am providing you a list of example editing instructions and their pairs of scores. 

{descriptions}

Generate additional {requested_number} editing instructions. Be concrete and come up with different instructions with various guesses for the possible edits that will minimize both of the scores. 
You can introduce new styles to the instructions, combine unique styles and textures from provided instructions to form new instructions, rephrase individual instructions, drop instruction parts, or simplify them. 
Be creative and don't be afraid to come up with erroneous editing instructions. Put each instruction in a different line, with a counter at the beginning (e.g. "1. ..."), and keep them short (less than 50 words).
