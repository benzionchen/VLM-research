You need to expand and rephrase the provided description for image generation to make the best image, by maximizing the image score:

The description is: {init_description}

Here are some example rephrases and the corresponding image scores: 

{descriptions}

Generate additional {requested_number} descriptions that will maximize the score. Be concrete and come up with different descriptions with various guesses for the possible way to rephrase and expand it, in a way that will maximize the score. 
You can introduce new elements to the descriptions, combine unique elements and phrasings from provided descriptions to form new ones, drop description parts, or simplify them. 
Be creative and don't be afraid to come up with erroneous descriptions. Put each instruction in a different line, with a counter at the beginning (e.g. "1. ..."), and keep them short (less than 77 words).
